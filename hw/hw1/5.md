Decouple process address space from the physical memory is a form of virtualization, which is called memory virtualization. There are many advantages of this virtualization.

1. It can isolate the memory of different process. After this virtualization, every process has its own address space, and will be managed to physical memory by operating system. So it will prevent accidentally access to other process's memory space, which inhance the security of memory.

2. It can simplify the memory management of the program. After virtualization, the memory provided by the system is an abstraction of memory, which is called address space. So to a program, it is no longer necessary to concern about the physical memory any more, which can make the memory management more simple.
