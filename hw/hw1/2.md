The fork() system call will create a new child process, which will be almost same with the parent process. Which means that the fork() will create a copy of the original process. 

The exec() system call will act completely different. Instead creating a new process, it will read the arguments and load the code and const data of the required program to overwrite the original process, the memory will be initialized. Which means that the exec() will replace the original program to another one.
