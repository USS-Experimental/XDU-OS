For a programmer dealing with low-level programming tasks, especially interacting with the operating system and hardware, the answer is yes. In different operating system or hardware, the form of system call can be different, and the interface provided by the system library can be different. In order to make the program working probably in cross-platform condition, knowing the library providing system call is a must. However, if the program is only restricted in high-level, such as Java programmer, it might not be necessary. Considering the existence of JVM, the system won't explosed to the programmer.
