**Question:**

1. What's the difference between mutex and semaphore? 
2. On all current computers, at least part of the interrupt handlers are written in assembly language. Why?

**Answer:**

1. Mutex is more like a lock, use to protect the critical region, main usage is lock and unlock. Semaphore is more like a counter, which contain more informantion than mutex, main usage is increase and decrease. Semaphore can be use as a lock just like mutex, however, it can also be use to do synchronize operation between thread and process.
2. When we deal with the interrupt problems, it is common to save and restore the condition of regester, using assembly language can let the programmer to operate regester directly. Besides, using assembly language can increase the effiency of the handler, it is very sensable to operating time.
